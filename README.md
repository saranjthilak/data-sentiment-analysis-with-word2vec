# 📊 Sentiment Analysis with Word2Vec

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis using **Word2Vec embeddings** to transform textual data into vector representations. It applies NLP techniques to classify sentiment (e.g., positive/negative) in text datasets, such as movie reviews or product feedback.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Preprocess raw text data using NLP techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- Train or load a Word2Vec model to convert words into vector embeddings.
- Use the embeddings to build feature vectors for text samples.
- Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) for sentiment classification.
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Gensim (for Word2Vec)
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
